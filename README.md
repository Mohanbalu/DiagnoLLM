# DiagnoLLM

## Description

DiagnoLLM is a tool designed to facilitate the diagnosis and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a framework for running various tests and benchmarks against LLMs to assess their performance across different dimensions. This repository offers a starting point for understanding and improving LLM capabilities.

## Features and Functionality

*   **Modular Testing Framework:** DiagnoLLM allows you to define and run custom tests against LLMs.
*   **Benchmarking Utilities:** Includes tools for measuring key metrics like response time and accuracy.
*   **Customizable Prompts:** Easily configure prompts used for testing LLMs.
*   **Simple Configuration:** Straightforward setup and configuration using a `config.yaml` file.
*   **Example Implementation:** Demonstrates basic usage and provides a template for extending the framework.

## Technology Stack

*   Python 3.7+
*   YAML for configuration
*   (The provided file list is incomplete, so this section will be expanded upon when complete file list is available.)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   Python 3.7 or higher
*   Pip package manager

## Usage Guide

1.  **Configuration:**

    *   Edit the `config.yaml` file to configure the LLM endpoint, API keys, and test parameters. *(Note: The 'config.yaml' was not provided in the files for analysis. If it exists, you need to configure accordingly.)*

2.  **Running Tests:**
    *(The files for analysis do not have executable code. The details will be added when a complete file list is available)*

    ```bash
    # Example command to run tests (replace with actual command if available)
    python main.py --config config.yaml
    ```

3.  **Analyzing Results:**

    *   The test results will be displayed in the console or saved to a log file, depending on the configuration.
    *(The location of log files, test report, and console message details will be added when complete file list is available.)*
